# smart-home-app
this app is an example for the automated home apps and how we could control any device and controll it from anywhere. 
the vision of the stakeholders is to go along with the new technologies, the new era by building an app that could cover all the needs that the users need in their homes like making coffee while they are in bed or even warming the house before coming back home, etc..  
# installation-process 
there are two ways for Android â€“ generating an .apk file and installing it directly on devices OR generating an .aab file which is recommended to upload on Play Store and then share it on test or production channels.

our smart home app will be installed in the first way till developing it and turns to the second way very soon....
