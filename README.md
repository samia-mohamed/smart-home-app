# smart-home-app
this app is an example for the automated home apps and how we could control any device and controll it from anywhere. 
the vision of the stakeholders is to go along with the new technologies, the new era by building an app that could cover all the needs that the users need in their homes like making coffee while they are in bed or even warming the house before coming back home, etc..
